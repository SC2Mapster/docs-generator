                <h1>Node: Effect: Spline Ribbon</h1>
                <p>The <em>SC2SplineRibbon</em> Node, found in the <em>Particle Systems</em> create panel, generates a special kind of ribbon, that follows a bezier curve between the start and end points.  In StarCraft II these ribbons are used for dynamic tubes, arcing lightning, and the stretchy part of the spine crawler.</p>
                <h2>Emission</h2>
                <div class="group">
                    <p>The Emission rollout defines properties for the overall look of the ribbon.  This includes the smoothness, shape, length, and direction the ribbon will take on.  These values define the creation of each segment of the ribbon.  They can often be animated to control the overall shape of the ribbon.</p>

                    <ol class="compact">
                        <li><p><em>Shape</em> defines the geometry of the Ribbon.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Planar billboarded</em> always faces the camera.</li>
                                <li><em>Planar</em> chooses a best-guess for ribbon direction based on control point locations</li>
                                <li><em>Cylinder</em> is a prism down the ribbon.</li>
                                <li><em>Star</em> allows for indents in the cylinder.</li>

                        <li><p><em>Inner Radius</em> sets, as a percentage, how deep the indents are for a star-shaped ribbon.  100% is the degenerate case, yielding a cylinder.  0% means the inner points of the star collapse to the center of the ribbon.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Max segs/sec</em> is the emission rate for the ribbon and has a direct impact on the performance characteristics of the ribbon.  Higher numbers will make the ribbon smoother, but more expensive to simulate and draw.  The estimated polygon count is generated below, though the actual count may be inaccurate for a <em>Length based</em> ribbon.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Lifespan</em> defines how the spline ribbon is culled.
							<ul>
								<li><em>Time Based</em> will make the ribbon appear as soon as it is present in the game, and last until it has been alive the number of game seconds defined in the <em>Lifetime</em> field.  This is most useful in cases where a model is birthed and the destroyed rapidly.</li>

                <div class="group">
                    <p>Noise is a post-simulation change to the appearance of the ribbon.  It is used to add seemingly random variation to the ribbon, while still allowing the user to operate on simple, editable, and understandable values for the rest of the ribbon.</p>

                    <ol class="compact">
                        <li><p><em>Frequency</em> regulates the rate of change in the noise pattern.  Higher values will have more varied noise, while lower values will induce less change over the course of the system.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Amplitude</em> scales the effect of noise on the system.  The higher the number, the further from an element's original point it can be pushed.  Note that noise is applied after tangents are generated, and therefore, high amplitudes can potentially create skewed lighting results.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Speed</em> alters the speed at which the offset values travel through the noise field.  A value of 0 will have static noise, while higher values will animate the noise more and more quickly.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Edge</em> mutes the noise closer to the emitter.  A value of 0, will have points being pushed immediately after being emitted, while a value of .5 will make points not receive the full amplitude of the noise until halfway down the length of the ribbon.</p></li>

                <div class="group">
                    <p>The Forcefield rollout is used to govern the interaction between <a href="Node_SC2Force.html">SC2Force</a> nodes and the ribbon start and end points.  Interactions between spline ribbons and forces are not well defined, and may cause the spline ribbon to not show up.  <em>Using this rollout is highly discouraged.</em></p>

                    <ol class="compact">
                        <li><p><em>Local Channels</em> lists the mask for particle/force interaction.  Elements from this system will interact only with <em>SC2Force</em> nodes that have at least one of the same channels enabled.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>World Profile</em> is a dropdown contain common sets of World Channels, to quickly choose common profiles.  This is more useful from the perspective of the force, rather than the receiver.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>World Channels</em> behave like <em>Local Channels</em> but across multiple objects.  For example, a flag fluttering in the wind would be enlisted in the <em>Wind</em> channel, and a nuclear explosion would use the <em>Wind</em> channel as well.  The result is that the explosion would push around the flag.  If they were not both in wind, the flag would not move.  This is for both artistic reasons and performance.  Common usage of the channels can be seen in the <em>World Profile</em> drop down.</p></li>
