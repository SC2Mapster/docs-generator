                <h1>Node: Effect: Particle</h1>
                <p>The <em>SC2Particle</em> Node, found in the <em>Particle Systems</em> create panel, emits a system of renderable points, called 'particles', based on its properties.  These particles simulate individually and are a fast way to create exciting visual effects.  In StarCraft II, these are used for sparks, spells, explosions, muzzle flashes, weather, fires, and more.</p>
                <h2>Emission</h2>
                <div class="group">
                    <p>The Emission rollout defines properties for the creation of every separate particle.  Many of these values can be animated, and control initial individual particle properties, such as when and where to create particles, what directions they should be travelling, and a few parameters that control the look of the system as a whole.</p>

                    <ol class="compact">
                        <li><p><em>Emitter Shape</em> defines the physical location from which particles spawn.  Distributions across the volume are not guaranteed to be even.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Point</em> spawns from exactly the SC2Particle node's position.</li>
                                <li><em>Plane</em> defines a flat square from which particles can be emitted, along the emitter's local XY-plane, and centered on the node.</li>
                                <li><em>Sphere</em> picks a point in the volume of a sphere around the node.</li>
                                <li><em>Box</em> uses a 3D box centered on the emitter node.</li>
                                <li><em>Cylinder</em> emits from a shape defined by a radius and height, centered on the emitter.</li>
                                <li><em>Disc</em> is a circle mounted to the emitter, oriented along the node's local XY-plane.</li>
                                <li><em>Spline</em> emits from along a spline picked in the <em>Linked Spline</em> dropdown.</li>
                                <li><em>Mesh</em> emits from the faces of the mesh picked in <em>Linked Mesh</em> dropdown.  If Vertex Color is applied and exported by the material on the mesh, then the Red channel of vertex color regulates the probability that a face will be used for particle emission.  Less red results in a lower probability.  If no red is present on a face, no particles will be emitted from it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Linked Spline</em> is used for <em>Spline</em> emitter shapes. The exporter will attempt to convert any spline that can be reduced to a single Bezier Spline.  Only valid splines will be listed here.  (Specifically, the exporter will first try to convert to a SplineShape, and extract exactly 1 BezierSpline from it.  Any node that can satisfy this condition should work.)</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Linked Mesh</em> is used for <em>Mesh</em> emitter shapes. It will only display meshes that will be exported.  If a mesh has a material set to <em>Export Vertex RGBA</em>, then the intensity of the Vertex Color Red will be used to define the distribution of emission over the mesh.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Lower Bounds</em> defines, for a <em>Spline</em>, what percentage along the spline it should start emitting from.  This allows emitting from sub-sections of splines.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Upper Bounds</em> defines, for a <em>Spline</em>, what percentage along the spline it should stop emitting from.  This allows emitting from sub-sections of splines.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Length (Outer Shape)</em> is the length dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local Y-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Width (Outer Shape)</em> is the width dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local X-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Height (Outer Shape)</em> is the height dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local Z-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Radius (Outer Shape)</em> is the radius in generic max units for round emitter shapes, or when using a <em>Spline</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Use Inner Shape</em> Enables an interior shape, which hollows out the emitter, allowing emission from only a shell.  Otherwise particles are emitted throughout the volume.  The inner shape is always the same as the shape of the emitter.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Length (Inner Shape)</em> is the length dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local Y-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Width (Inner Shape)</em> is the width dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local X-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Height (Inner Shape)</em> is the height dimension in generic max units for emitter shapes that require it, and generally correlates with the local Z-axis.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Radius (Inner Shape)</em> is the radius in generic max units for round emitter shapes, or when using a <em>Spline</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Auto Calculate</em> forces the exporter to attempt to calculate the <em>Max. Particles</em> field based on the <em>Emission Rate</em>, the <em>squirt quantity</em>, and the <em>Lifetime</em> of the particles.  For simple particle systems, this is almost always correct, but for complex animated parameters, this may need to be disabled.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Max. Particles</em> is the upper bound for the number of particles a particle system can have.  This is critical for performance, and a lower number is better.  Note that particles that are currently alive are favored over creating new particles, and thus a number that is too small here may cause hitches in emission.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Emission Rate</em> defines the number of particles per second that will spawn.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Squirt Quantity</em> is a special keyframe triggered field for burst particle emission.  When there is a keyframe that is non-zero, and differs in value from the previous keyframe, exactly that number of particles (subject to Graphics settings) will be created at that time.  This is useful for explosions and other instantaneous effects.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Lifetime</em> is the time, in seconds, that a particle will live for.  Most effects in <em>Per-particle Parameters</em> are normalized across this lifetime.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Range (Lifetime)</em> enables randomized lifetimes among particles, allowing for more variety in the look of the particle system.  When enabled, the field is the maximum lifetime of a particle.  It must always be larger than <em>Lifetime</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Kill sphere</em>, when non-zero, is a hard-stop distance that will instantly kill a particle when it exceeds this distance.  This is measured from the <em>SC2Particle</em> node, and not the point of emission.  Particles that spawn outside the sphere will be visible for exactly one frame.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Local Time</em> toggles the particle system between simulating in real time or synced with the animation.  If the particle system should simulate in "real-time" no matter what, this checkbox should remain unchecked.  Check it if the particle system should adjust to match the animation speed.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Pre-pump</em> simulates the particle system prior to its first appearance on screen, making it appear at full strength, rather than "filling up" the first time it appears.  This is used to make a particle system look like it has been running already when first seen.  <em>Squirt</em> will not be pre-pumped.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Grid</em> is currently broken and not advised to be used.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Initial Velocity</em> defines the direction particles should be traveling when emitted.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Constant</em> picks a direction based on the <em>Yaw</em> and <em>Pitch</em> settings.</li>
                                <li><em>Radial</em> always pushes away from the center of the emitter node.</li>
                                <li><em>Z-axis</em> picks randomly to move in the direction of the positive or negative local Z-Axis for the emitter.</li>
                                <li><em>Random</em> picks an entirely arbitrary orientation.</li>
                                <li><em>Mesh Normal</em> when using a <em>Mesh</em> <em>Emitter Shape</em>, uses the normal of the face being emitted from as the direction vector.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Yaw</em> rotates emission along the SC2Particle node's local X-axis. ( The button to the right may be used to add procedural overlay noise to this field. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Pitch</em> rotates emission along the SC2Particle node's local Y-axis. ( The button to the right may be used to add procedural overlay noise to this field. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Horz Spread</em> gives a randomized range of angles from which particles can spawn.  The axis of freedom corresponds to the axis of freedom for <em>Pitch</em>. ( The button to the right may be used to add procedural overlay noise to this field. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Vert Spread</em> gives a randomized range of angles from which particles can spawn.  The axis of freedom corresponds to the axis of freedom for <em>Yaw</em>. ( The button to the right may be used to add procedural overlay noise to this field. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Speed</em> sets the magnitude of each particle's direction vector when it is emitted. ( The button to the right may be used to add procedural overlay noise to this field. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Range (Speed)</em> enables randomized speed among particles, allowing for more variety in the look of the particle system.  When enabled, the field is the maximum speed of a particle.  It must always be larger than <em>Speed</em>. ( This will disable procedural overlay noise on <em>Speed</em>. )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Inherit Parent Velocity</em> makes each particle add the velocity of the model it is part of when it is emitted.  This makes the system look like it is moving with the model as opposed to being dropped off in space.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>% (Inherit Parent Velocity)</em> denotes the percentage transfer of parent velocity to each emitted particle if <em>Inherit Parent Velocity</em> is turned on.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Instance Type</em> controls the shape of particles in the particle system.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Billboard</em> will always be square to the camera.</li>
                                <li><em>Tail</em> will face the camera, but be elongated based on <em>Tail Length</em> and distance traveled.</li>
                                <li><em>Facing Traveling Direction</em> sets the particle's face normal to be the direction it travels.  Up and Right vectors are derived from the emitter.</li>
                                <li><em>World Facing Direction</em> makes all particles face in a worldspace direction defined by <em>Yaw (Instance Type)</em> and <em>Pitch (Instance Type)</em>.</li>
                                <li><em>Single Axis</em> particles will face the camera by rotating along only one axis, defined by <em>Yaw (Instance Type)</em> and <em>Pitch (Instance Type)</em>.</li>
                                <li><em>Ground Oriented</em> will make a particle's default orientation match that of the heightmap below the particle.  Particles can be spun with <em>Pitch (Instance Type)</em>.</li>
                                <li><em>Ground Direction Oriented</em> matches the ground for facing direction, but leaves a trail similar to <em>Tail</em> in the XY plane.  The orientation matches the direction the particle is traveling.</li>
                                <li><em>Emitter Oriented</em> will set each particle to face the same direction as the SC2Particle node's local Z-axis.  This is most notable when <em>Pitch</em> and <em>Yaw</em> are used, causing divergence between the emission direction and the node's physical direction.</li>
                                <li><em>Physics Normal Oriented</em> will orient the particle in the direction of the surface it was generated off of if and only if it was generated as a result of terrain or object collision.  For particles not generated in this manner, this will yield undefined results.</li>
                                <li><em>Pinned</em> will create a stretched quad for each particle.  This quad will face the camera and its end points will be the initial position of the particle, and the current position of the particle.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Tail Length</em> defines the ratio of <em>Size</em> to the length of a particle tail.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Yaw (Instance Type)</em> controls the shape of particles in the particle system.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Pitch (Instance Type)</em> controls the shape of particles in the particle system.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Offset</em> expands the leading edge of a <em>Pinned</em> particle.  The width of the leading edge is <em>Size</em> * ( 1 + <em>Offset</em> ).</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Clamped Tail Length</em> makes tail-type particles start with zero length and max out at their <em>Tail Length</em>. ( Behavior is undefined with <em>Pinned</em> Particle Systems )</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Fixed Tail Length</em> forces a particle tail to start, and remain, at its <em>Length</em> for the duration of the particle lifetime.  When unchecked, physical particle tail length is Velocity * Size * Length / 100.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Use Model</em> allows the user to pick a Group in the same file to be replicated for every particle.  When enabled, the button enters model selection mode.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Swap Y & Z</em> changes the forward vector of the model selected in <em>Use Model</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Sorted (could be slow)</em> will force particle to sort themselves based on depth, so that the closest to the camera draws "in front".  Normally, particles will be traversed in their order in memory.  Which would favor putting particles emitted first "behind" the others visually, but will have occasional sorting artifacts.  If the <em>SC2 Standard Material</em> assigned to a particle system has a <em>Blend Mode</em> of <em>Add</em>, this flag does nothing except make the particle system more expensive to calculate.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Sort based on Z height</em> forces sorting to be done based on the height along the Z-axis, rather than distance to the camera.  This is particularly useful for <em>Ground</em> oriented particles, where they may visually intersect incorrectly otherwise.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Reverse iteration</em> makes the renderer traverse the particle system back to front.  Visually this inverts the sorting order of the particles.  Without the <em>Sorted</em> checked, particles emitted first will generally appear "in front" of others.  With <em>Sorted</em>, the furthest away will appear "in front".</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Trail % Chance</em> sets the percentage of particles emitted that can generate trailing particles.  Whether or not a child will generate children is decided at the time of emission, and it will keep this property throughout its lifetime.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Emission Rate</em> defines at what rate the child particles will be spawned. Note that this ignores the child particle system's <em>Emission</em> properties, but respects <em>Max. Particles</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Picker (Particle Trail Emission)</em> allows the user to select a child particle system for use with emission trails.  Properties pertaining to <em>Emission</em>, <em>Speed</em> and <em>Shape</em> are ignored.</p></li>
